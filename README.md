 # Jumpy platformer challenge
 
 This repository contains a base Jumpy platformer Arcade MakeCode project to create a good challenge for your game developing skills. Are you ready? :-)
 
 First, [open the game](https://llyorshch.github.io/jumpy-platformer-base/) and get used to the controls in level one. Continue to level 2 and... try to get to the end of the level. As you can imagine, the level 2 is intentionally impossible. So, what you can do? Hey, you're a programmer, you are reading this in GitHub isn't it?
