## First of all, play a little bit

 Use the game in the top left corner to get used to the controls in level one. Continue to level 2 and... try to get to the end of the level. As you can imagine, the level 2 is intentionally impossible. So, what you can do? Hey, you're a programmer, you are reading this in GitHub isn't it?

## Challenge

Get to the end of level 3.

## Rules

- You are not allowed to change the "world" of the game, that is, you cannot change the scenario or the physics (gravity).
- You can add "super-powers" to your hero to make him do dash-jumps, jumps from wall to wall or any other thing that does the job. Remember, you cannot "remove" gravity in order to make your hero fly.
- Do not break the game. We don't want poltergeists. Of course you can change the position of the hero to get to the end of the level but... that wouldn't be challenging, isn't it? ;-)
